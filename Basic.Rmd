## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. 

Reference sheets:

* In RStudio, click 'Help' menu and then 'Markdown Quick Reference'
* https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf

## Knit

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

## Adding code

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Hiding code

Sometimes you want to compute something and only show the finished calculation in your report.


```{r dontshow, echo=FALSE}
x <- mtcars$mpg
y <- mtcars$wt
y2 <- y^2
```

The values are stored and now I can reference them later.

```{r plot2}
plot(x, y2)
```

## Troubleshooting

The bit after `r` is a label.  You can leave it blank but if you include, you cannot duplicate labels in your report.

Line feeds are important.  If you are having trouble, make sure you have line feeds before and after headers and code.
